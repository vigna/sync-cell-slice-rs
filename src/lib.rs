use std::cell::Cell;

/// A mutable memory location that is [`Sync`].
///
/// # Memory layout
///
/// `SyncCell<T>` has the same memory layout and caveats as [`Cell<T>`], but it
/// is [`Sync`] if `T` is. In particular, if [`Cell<T>`] has the same in-memory
/// representation as its inner type `T`, then `SyncCell<T>` has the same
///  in-memory representation as its inner type `T` (but the code does not rely
/// on this). `SyncCell<T>` is also [`Send`] if [`Cell<T>`] is [`Send`].
///
/// `SyncCell<T>` is useful when you need to share a mutable memory location
/// across threads, and you rely on the fact that the intended behavior will not
/// cause data races. For example, the content will be written once and then
/// read many times, in this order.
///
/// The main usage of `SyncCell<T>` is to be to able to write to different
/// locations of a slice in parallel, leaving the control of data races to the
/// user, without the access cost of an atomic variable. For this purpose,
/// `SyncCell` implements the [`as_slice_of_cells`](SyncCell::as_slice_of_cells)
/// method, which turns a mutable reference to `SyncCell<[T]>` into a reference
/// to `[SyncCell<T>]`, similarly to the [analogous method of
/// `Cell`](Cell::as_slice_of_cells).
///
/// Since this is the most common usage, the extension trait [`SyncSlice`] adds
/// to slices a method [`as_sync_slice`](SyncSlice::as_sync_slice) that turns a
/// mutable reference to a slice of `T` into a reference to a slice of
/// `SyncCell<T>`.
///
/// # Methods
///
/// `SyncCell<T>` painstakingly reimplements the methods of `Cell<T>` as unsafe,
/// since they rely on external synchronization mechanisms to avoid undefined
/// behavior.
///
/// `SyncCell` implements a few traits implemented by [`Cell`] by delegation for
/// convenience, but some, as [`Clone`] or [`PartialOrd`], cannot be implemented
/// because they would use unsafe methods.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Multiple thread can read from and write to the same `SyncCell` at the same
/// time. It is responsibility of the user to ensure that there are no data
/// races, which would cause undefined behavior.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// In this example, you can see that `SyncCell` enables mutation across
/// threads:
///
/// ```
/// use sync_cell_slice::SyncCell;
/// use sync_cell_Slice::SyncSlice;
///
/// let mut x = 0;
/// let c = SyncCell::new(x);
///
/// let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
/// let s = v.as_sync_slice();
///
/// std::thread::scope(|scope| {
///     scope.spawn(|| {
///         // You can use interior mutability in another thread
///         unsafe { c.set(5) };
///     });
///
///     scope.spawn(|| {
///         // You can use interior mutability in another thread
///         unsafe { s[0].set(5) };
///     });
///     scope.spawn(|| {
///         // You can use interior mutability in another thread
///         // on the same slice
///         unsafe { s[1].set(10) };
///     });
/// });
/// ```
///
/// In this example, we invert a permutation in parallel:
///
/// ```
/// use sync_cell_slice::SyncCell;
/// use sync_cell_slice::SyncSlice;
///
/// let mut perm = vec![0, 2, 3, 1];
/// let mut inv = vec![0; perm.len()];
/// let inv_sync = inv.as_sync_slice();
///
/// std::thread::scope(|scope| {
///     scope.spawn(|| { // Invert first half
///         for i in 0..2 {
///             unsafe { inv_sync[perm[i]].set(i) };
///         }
///     });
///
///     scope.spawn(|| { // Invert second half
///         for i in 2..perm.len() {
///             unsafe { inv_sync[perm[i]].set(i) };
///        }
///     });
/// });
///
/// assert_eq!(inv, vec![0, 3, 1, 2]);
